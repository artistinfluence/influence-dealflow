Stream goals are guaranteed, and every campaign includes weekly reporting, performance tracking, and strategic playlist placement to boost saves, followers, and engagement.',

We handpick creators (not recycled influencers) for each campaign to ensure relevance and cost-efficiency, maximizing ROI and discovery. Every post tags the artist, links the sound, and is tracked via a live dashboard so you can see real-time results.',

We build layered interest, behavior, and look-alike audiences drawn from your past viewers and genre peers, then continually A/B test creatives, hooks, and copy to lock in the lowest possible CPVs in high-value territories. Campaigns include real-time budget pacing, exclusion of bot-heavy regions, and remarketing to warm fansâ€”driving qualified traffic back to YouTube, Spotify, or your next drop. Weekly reporting provides full delivery metrics plus audience insights, so you always know where growth is coming from.',
    'TikTok Spark Ads': 'Our Spark Ads service turns native TikTok contentâ€”either your own or our recommended creativesâ€”into powerful ads served directly in the For You feed. These campaigns deliver best-in-class CPVs (as low as $0.03), with precision targeting for playlisting, ticket sales, or streaming. We optimize your campaign daily by scaling top-performing creatives and provide clear weekly reporting and final data exports.'
